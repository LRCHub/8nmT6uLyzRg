# Freddie Dredd – SACRIFICE MYSELF

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Playin' with the motherfuckin' master, I'm
Pla-pla-playin' with the motherfuckin' master
Doomshop, motherfucker
Playin' with the motherfuckin' master, I'm Freddie
Playin' with the motherfuckin' master
Playin'-playin'-playin' with the motherfuckin' master, I'm
Pla-pla-playin'-with-playin'-with-playin'-master

I'm on the edge, mane
Feel my life, it's creepin' off from under me
The feds, mane, see them peepin' through my windows everyday
They know I got a special product
Got my shit, I gotta hide it, in the walls and in my trunk
My stomach fill with powder dust
Gonna die, now say goodbye

I'm lookin' straight into my eyes
They dead as fuck, I'm ready though
I'm ready, fuckin ready mode
I'm fading out, I feel the pain
I see the light, I see my name
Now, take it, baby, once a friend
You know that Freddie's born again

Sacrifice myself, I did it
Did it for the darkest wishes
Then realized that, man, I miss it
Trust me, bitch, I'm steady living
Never die, say never will
You know that Freddie signed that deal
Here from ashes, born from dust
Freddie's back and that's a must

Lost my soul a while ago
And I'll never say I missed it
'Cause I died up all alone
When I risked it for the business
Freddie's here, you'll never know
Feel the killa' whistlin' cold
See the window fuckin' froze
Back again to cut your throat

Sacrifice myself, I did it
Sacrifice myself, I did it
Sacrifice myself, I did it
Did it for the darkest wishes
Then realized that, man, I miss it
Trust me

I'm on the edge, mane
Feel my life, it's creepin' off from under me
The feds, mane, see them peepin' through my windows everyday
They know I got a special product
Got my shit, I gotta hide it, in the walls and in my trunk
My stomach fill with powder dust
Gonna die, now say goodbye

I'm lookin' straight into my eyes
They dead as fuck, I'm ready though
I'm ready, fuckin ready mode
I'm fading out, I feel the pain
I see the light, I see my name
Now, take it, baby, once a friend
You know that Freddie's born again
